## CSS Relative Units

### Objectives

- Develop familiarity with em and rem units


### Instructions

Included in this repository are the following files.

- README.md
- css
  - style.css
- img
  - limes.png
- index.html

`index.html` is a modernized, modified mockup of Andy Budd's CSS Zen Garden entry, [sub:lime](http://www.csszengarden.com/046/). However, all units have been written in pixels (`px`).

Your task is to convert these property values to use ems and rems.

1. Clone this repository.

2. Create a branch from the `master` in which you will convert all pixel values to `rem` values. Name it appropriately. Change all values in `style.css` which display a pixel-based value. Set the root font size to `18px`. Add a comment showing your math to next to each line in which a change is made. For instance:

```
font-size: 4.5em; /* 72px / 16px */
```

When finished, test your code to see if you a) caught every instance of a pixel and b) if the design scales. Change the root font size to something different. Try a value larger and a value smaller.

3. You will create another new branch from `master` in which you will convert all pixel values to `em` values. Do not set a root font size, but set the `font-size` in `body` to `12px`. Follow all other instructions outlined in step 1. When testing the final result, change the font size set in body to a different value.

**Good Luck!**
