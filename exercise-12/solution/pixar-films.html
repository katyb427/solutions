      document.write("<ul>");

      for(var film in pixarMovies) {
        // What is being returned exactly? Let's test in the console.
        console.log(film);

        // That's just each film. :( How do we get the data we want about
        // each film?
        console.log(pixarMovies[film]);

        // Ah ha! Now we can get the data from each film!

        // Now we print the data to the screen:
        document.write("<li>" + pixarMovies[film]["title"] + ": " + pixarMovies[film]["year"] + "</li>");
      }

      document.write("</ul>");


      // Remember, each film in pixarMovies is an object. When we
      // iterate over pixarMovies, we store one film at a time in
      // the step of the loop we are on. (So, the first iteration of
      // the loop holds all the data for toyStory, the second for
      // aBugsLife, etc.)

      // In order to refer to each individual film, which is stored
      // in the "counter" variable 'film', we use pixarFilms[film].

      // But what about the data for each film? The property names
      // (i.e. title, year, actors, etc.) are standard throughout
      // the object. We use strings in this case -- "title" and "year".

      // If we think of the object as a tree, the path to the data
      // we seek is a little something like this:

      // pixarMovies -> toyStory -> title
      // pixarMovies -> toyStory -> year
      // pixarMovies -> aBugsLife -> title
      // pixarMovies -> aBugsLife -> year

      // Notice only the film name changes! That's why we the 'film'
      // variable and not something static.

      // WHY?! are we going through such pain with this example?
      // Because one of the KEY uses of loops over objects and
      // arrays is to process JSON. It is a popular way of being
      // able to take data -- just like pixarMovies! -- and
      // processing it for display on the web!

      // We will discuss that at a later date. But for now, practice
      // iterating over arrays and objects! It's extremely valuable!
